Explorations of the theory of conformal prediction:

1. `conformal_learning_from_scratch.ipynb` - We will build a conformal classifier step-by-step explaining the required background on the way. 
In the end, we will confirm that the constructed model gives the same results as the code from [`nonconformist`](https://github.com/donlnz/nonconformist) library.
